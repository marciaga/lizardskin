# Lizard Skin site

## Development

Ensure the most recent of Node LTS (currently it's v12) is installed: [link](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Then, run
```sh
$ cd lizardskin
$ npm install
```

Run the dev server:
```sh
$ npm start
```

A browser tab will open at localhost:3000.

The `index.html` file is located in `src/`

CSS files should be added to `src/styles`. The build process extracts all the styles and adds them to the `<head>`.

The page will automatically refresh whenever you save a file.
